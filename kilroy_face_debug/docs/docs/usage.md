# Usage

This package provides a **kilroy** face with behavior useful for debugging.

## Running the server

To run the server, install the package and run the following command:

```sh
kilroy-face-debug
```

This will start the face server on port 9999 by default.
Then you can communicate with the server, for example by using
[this package](https://github.com/kilroybot/kilroy-face-client-py-sdk).
